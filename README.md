# Grappling Notation Specification

A symbolic notation system for grappling, inspired by chess notation and fighting game move lists.  
This project provides a living standard you can extend over time to record matches, study flows, or analyze drills.  

## Quick Example

```text
[Gordon ↳ Giancarlo] :: Americana @ Mount
[Gordon ↳ Giancarlo] :: Triangle @ Guard !!
[Gordon ↳ Giancarlo] :: Kimura >> Armbar @ Half Guard
```

- `↳`: Submission attempt
- `::`: Separates actors and action metadata
- `@`: Position
- `>>`: Chained attempts
- `!!`: finished
