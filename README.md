# Grappling Notation Specification

A symbolic notation system for grappling, inspired by chess notation and fighting game move lists.  
This project provides a living standard you can extend over time to record matches, study flows, or analyze drills.  

## Quick Example

```text
[Gordon ↳ Andre] :: Kimura >> Americana @ Side Control
[Gordon] :: Half Guard @ Guard
[Giancarlo ↳ Ronaldo] :: Armbar @ Juji Gatame ~ Belly Down !!
```

- `↳`: Submission attempt
- `::`: Separates actors and action metadata
- `@`: Position
- `>>`: Chained attempts
- `!!`: finished
